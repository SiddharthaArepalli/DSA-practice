Introduction

The video is about 2 pointers and sliding window concepts in algorithms
The concepts will be explained through examples and templates
Pattern 1: Constant Window

The problem involves finding the maximum sum of a constant window size

>>> The template involves:

Initialize two pointers, L and R, to the start of the array
Calculate the sum of the window
If the sum is valid, update the maximum length
Move the window to the right by incrementing R
If the sum is not valid, move the window to the right by incrementing L
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

>> Pattern 2: Longest Subarray

The problem involves finding the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to K
The template involves:
Initialize two pointers, L and R, to the start of the array
Calculate the sum of the window
If the sum is valid, update the maximum length
Move the window to the right by incrementing R
If the sum is not valid, move the window to the right by incrementing L and subtracting the leftmost element
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

>> Optimization

In some cases, the shrinking process can be optimized by not shrinking the window all the way back to the start
Instead, shrink the window by one element at a time and check if the sum is valid
Pattern 3: Number of Subarrays

The problem involves finding the number of subarrays with a sum equal to K
The template involves:
Solve two problems: find the number of subarrays with sum less than or equal to K, and find the number of subarrays with sum less than or equal to K-1
Subtract the two results to get the final answer
This pattern is solved using the Pattern 2 template

 >> Pattern 4: Minimum Window

The problem involves finding the minimum window with a sum greater than or equal to K
The template involves:
Initialize two pointers, L and R, to the start of the array
Calculate the sum of the window
If the sum is valid, try to shrink the window by incrementing L
If the sum is not valid, move the window to the right by incrementing R
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
